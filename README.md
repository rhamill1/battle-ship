Phase 2 - Elaborate | clean looking and performing 1 round game
    Goals
        function
            display guess and result text in the browser - Good
            allow user to reset the game - Good
        form
            remove hard coding from css.  make responsive - Good

            All the labels, submits and commentary at the top is looking cluttered scratch these goals
                format grid to stay on screen
                format grid axis to be clean and consistent (margins, padding and borders)

Phase 3 -

    Add two more columns
    remove the guess section and allow the hide section to be repurposed for both
